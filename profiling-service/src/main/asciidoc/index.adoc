{app-title} provides the ability to collect arbitrary demographic profiling data and search for sample
based on a set of criteria.

[[overview]]
= Overview

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP Verbs

{app-title} tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource.

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource.

| `PATCH`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource.
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP Status Codes

{app-title} tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully.

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header.

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully.

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information.

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist.
|===

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following structure:

include::{snippets}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, a request that attempts to apply a non-existent constraint to a field will produce a
`400 Bad Request` response:

include::{snippets}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

{app-title} uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
from resource to resource.
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate.

[[overview-pagination]]
== Pagination

Many collection resources support pagination. If this is the case, a `page` key will be included.

This contains the following:

|===
| Path | Type | Description

| `+size+`
| `+Number+`
| The number of resources included in each page.

| `+totalElements+`
| `+Number+`
| The total number of resources in the collection.

| `+totalPages+`
| `+Number+`
| The total number of pages.

| `+number+`
